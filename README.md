# From Imperative code to Functional code

This repository is based on John De Goes's talk [FP to the max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxudIMiOo68), where imperative code is transformed to a functional equivalent. I am using [Bow 0.1.0](https://github.com/arrow-kt/bow), a library for typed functional programming written in Swift, to use several FP constructions that help me perform this task.

You can see the correspondence of this code with the talk in:

- [Imperative version](https://github.com/truizlop/ImperativeToFunctional/blob/master/ImperativeToFunctional/Imperative/ImperativeMain.swift): minute 7:10
- [Monomorphic functional version](https://github.com/truizlop/ImperativeToFunctional/blob/master/ImperativeToFunctional/Monomorphic/MonomorphicMain.swift): minute 2:20
- [Polymorphic Tagless-Final version](https://github.com/truizlop/ImperativeToFunctional/blob/master/ImperativeToFunctional/TaglessFinal/TaglessFinalMain.swift): minute 47:58
